# Reverse String

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- s[i] is a printable ascii character.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int left=0;
        int right=s.size()-1;
        while(left<right){
            swap(s[left],s[right]);
            left++;
            right--;
        }
          for (char c : s) {
        cout << c;
    }
    }
};
```
