# Distinct Subsequences II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

Given a string s, return  *the number of  **distinct non-empty subsequences**  of*  `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it  **modulo**  `109 + 7`.

A  **subsequence**  of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "aa", "ba", and "aba".

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= s.length <= 2000
- s consists of lowercase English letters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int distinctSubseqII(string s) {
        const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;

        // dp = number of distinct subsequences including empty subsequence
        long long dp = 1;

        // last[c] = dp value before the previous occurrence of c
        vector<long long> last(26, 0);

        for (char c : s) {
            int x = c - 'a';

            long long newDp = (2 * dp - last[x] + MOD) % MOD;

            last[x] = dp;
            dp = newDp;
        }

        // Remove empty subsequence
        return (dp - 1 + MOD) % MOD;
    }
};

```
